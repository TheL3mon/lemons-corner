        <h3>Chips Reviews</h3>
        <b>Cheetos Cheese Puffs</b><br>
        The good old classic. No matter how many flavours Cheetos comes up with, this one remains the king of all the puffs, till the end of time. Cheeto fingers? I mean come on! And does anyone remember those cool collectibles they came with, back in the early 00's? I'm pretty sure I still have my Pok√©mon Tazos somewhere!<br>
        <i>10/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Cheetos Ketchup Sticks</b><br>
        I gotta admit, I like these even more than the OG cheese puffs, but I don't think I have the courage to decrown them with this. Besides, I'm pretty sure the chips mafia would hunt me down in a minute if I done that.<br>
        <i>9.5/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Cheetos Ketchup & Cheese Twisted Puffs</b><br>
        I thought I would have liked these a lot because it combines my two favourite Cheetos flavours, cheese and ketchup... but boy is this bland at best! :T<br>
        <i>5/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Xtra Salty Potato Chips</b> (it's a Danish thing that I nicknamed "cheap-ass-chips" because of it's low price)<br>
        Now THIS is what peak performance tastes like! Nothing like a good old, original, salty potato chips, from the land of potatoes, Denmark! I looove it!<br>
        <i>10/10</i><br><br>
        <b>KiMs Double Spiced Margherita with Tomato and Cheese + Basil Oil</b><br>
        An amazing creation from this stupidly overpriced brand! It is creamy and has a really nice balance between the quite lenghty list of flavours that makes me want to sell my kidney again for another bag.<br>
        <i>9.5/10</i><br><br>
