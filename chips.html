        <h3>Chips Reviews</h3>
        <b>Cheetos Cheese Puffs</b><br>
        The good old classic. No matter how many flavours Cheetos comes up with, this one remains the king of all the puffs, till the end of time. Cheeto fingers? I mean come on! And does anyone remember those cool collectibles they came with, back in the early 00's? I'm pretty sure I still have my Pok√©mon Tazos somewhere!<br>
        <i>10/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Cheetos Ketchup Sticks</b><br>
        I gotta admit, I like these even more than the OG cheese puffs, but I don't think I have the courage to decrown them with this. Besides, I'm pretty sure the chips mafia would hunt me down in a minute if I done that.<br>
        <i>9.5/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Cheetos Ketchup & Cheese Twisted Puffs</b><br>
        I thought I would have liked these a lot because it combines my two favourite Cheetos flavours, cheese and ketchup... but boy is this bland at best! :T<br>
        <i>5/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Xtra Salty Potato Chips</b> (it's a Danish thing that I nicknamed "cheap-ass-chips" because of it's low price)<br>
        Now THIS is what peak performance tastes like! Nothing like a good old, original, salty potato chips, from the land of potatoes, Denmark! I looove it!<br>
        <i>10/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Xtra Sour Cream & Onion Potato Chips</b><br>
        Not my favourite flavour as I can't eat too much of it, and the dust it leaves on your fingers is too potent and sour, so your only option is to wash your hands which kinda destroys the whole point of having chips dust on your fingers in the first place. However, this is a nice try from Xtra. I can imagine bringing this to a party because it's cheap and looks like you actually tried (although, deep down, every chips connoisseur knows that's a feckin' lie).<br>
        <i>6/10</i><br><br>
        <b>KiMs Double Spiced Margherita with Tomato and Cheese + Basil Oil</b><br>
        An amazing creation from this stupidly overpriced brand! It is creamy and has a really nice balance between the quite lenghty list of flavours that makes me want to sell my kidney again for another bag.<br>
        <i>9.5/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Coop Peanut Flips</b><br>
        Peanut puffs cannot turn out bad, I truly believe that. This one is another fine example of this statement, although there's nothing more to it other than that. Just average, peanut puffs.<br>
        <i>8/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Coop Cheeseflips</b><br>
        A cheaper alternative in the cheese puff department, but nothing special. I feel like it's a bit more oily than Cheetos, so don't expect cheeto fingers this time. Sad emoji.<br>
        <i>7/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Coop Ranchers Cut Jalapenos</b><br>
        Ah yes, the good old "let's use regular pepper and add a tiny pinch of artifical spice to it because white people can't handle anything above 100 Scoville" tactic. The flavour is alright, but come on! I cannot Coop with this... (haha get it?)<br>
        <i>7/10</i><br><br>
        <b>Coop Ranchers Cut Sour Cream & Onion</b><br>
        I usually have a hard time with sour cream & onion chips as this is the kind of snack that you can not eat too much of. Somehow it always leaves me feeling sick. Not taking this into consideration however, this one's still kinda just meh.<br>
