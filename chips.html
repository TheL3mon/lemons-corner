        <i>Cheetos Cheese Puffs</i><br>
        The good old classic. No matter how many flavours Cheetos comes up with, this one remains the king of all the puffs, till the end of time. Cheeto fingers? I mean come on! And does anyone remember those cool collectibles they came with back in the early 00's? I'm pretty sure I still have my Pok√©mon Tazos somewhere!<br>

        <i>Cheetos Ketchup Sticks</i><br>
        I gotta admit, I like these even more than the OG cheese puffs, but I don't think I have the courage to decrown them with this. Besides, I'm pretty sure the chips mafia would hunt me down in a minute if I done that.<br>
