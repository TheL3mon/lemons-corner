            <p class="project_bodytext">
                For the final exam of the Graphics&nbsp;Programming course at ITU, I chose to recreate the sand shader of <i>Journey</i>.<br>
                This project was made with pure C++ and GLSL (OpenGL). You can read my paper for details <a href="Journey_Sand_in_OpenGL.pdf" target="_blank" class="project_link">[<img src="images/others/pdf.png" class="project_icon" style="width: 0.7vw;">&nbsp;here]</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytext">
                As the first step, I looked at <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017742/Sand-Rendering-in" target="_blank" class="project_link">[this]</a> GDC talk by John Edwards of <i>thatgamecompany</i><br>
                to analyze the approach the developers took when creating the original shader for <i>Journey</i>.<br>
                They broke down the technique into various layers, such as the diffuse layer, rim lighting, or the ocean specular.<br>
                This was incredibly helpful, as I got to understand what went into the various elements of their approach.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytext">
                For my project, I decided to use a deferred rendering model, as it provides better performance<br>
                in scenes with many light sources, such as the game's later levels.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/J_diffuse.png" class="project_image" style="width: 35vw;"><br>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Lambert.png" class="project_image" style="width: 18vw;">
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Lambert_journey.png" class="project_image" style="width: 25vw;">
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                The scattered light is calculated through the Lambertian reflectance model. Its implementation in <i>Journey</i> slightly differs, however.<br>
                To accentuate the reflections, the up axis of the normal is reduced and the overall intenstiy of the reflectance is increased.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Oren.png" class="project_image" style="width: 50vw;">
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                During the talk, it was mentioned that the developers originally intended to use the Oren–Nayar reflectance model instead to calculate the diffuse layer,<br>
                but it proved to be costly which the PlayStation 3 couldn't handle.<br>
                Out of curiosity, I implemented it as a secondary option, which can be turned on via the debug menu.<br>
                After reverese engineering the shaders of the PC port, I found out that the game still uses Oren-Nayar, but only on the clothing of the player character.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytext">
                The glittery layer that is meant to represent the individual grains of sand is achieved by using a noise texture as normal map.<br>
                I used Gaussian normal distribution to generate the noise.<br>
                By using <i>RenderDoc</i>, I discovered the different mipmap resolutions used in the game, which then I could use in my own implementation as well.
            </p>

                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Fresnel.png" class="project_image" style="width: 22vw;">
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                To create the rim lighting seen on the edges of the sand dunes, I used Schlick's approximation of the Fresnel factor.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/J_ocean.png" class="project_image" style="width: 45vw;"><br>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Specular.png" class="project_image" style="width: 22vw;">
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                In <i>Journey</i>, the sand dunes have an ocean-like quality to them. The dunes reflect a strong light beam as the sun hits the surface.<br>
                I replicated this magical effect by implementing the specular formula of the Blinn-Phong reflection model.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/J_sparkles.png" class="project_image" style="width: 45vw;">
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                When we are looking at larger bodies of sand, some grains stand out as they are perfectly oriented in a way that the light gets reflected directly into our eyes.<br>
                These larger sparks I replicated through a specular map that has larger, sparsely scattered grains.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/J_waves.png" class="project_image" style="width: 35vw;"><br>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Slerp.png" class="project_image" style="width: 22vw;">
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                As the final layer, I recreated the "waves" on top of the dunes by blending in additional normals.<br>
                This layer samples two textures, one used for longer waves and another for smaller ones.<br>
                By using Kevin Shoemake's three-way linear interpolation formula, I could interpolate between these two textures based on the steepness of the dunes.<br>
                The steeper sides have longer waves, while the more horizontal areas sample the smaller ones.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/projects/journey_sand/Anisotropy.png" class="project_image" style="width: 45vw;"><br>
            </div>
            <p class="project_bodytext">
                To make the textures render crisp, I enabled anisotropic filtering. This makes sure that the grains don't become blurry when observed at lower angles.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytext">
                For additional flair, I also implemented bloom as post-processing effect, as it is quite prominent in <i>Journey</i> as well.
