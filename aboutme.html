            <p class="project_bodytext">
                Heyo! I'm Daniel.<br>Game developer, living in Copenhagen. Fresh graduate of Games MSc from the IT&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Copenhagen.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytextleft">
                I've been playing games since forever. My very first gaming memories come from bootleg MS-DOS games
                that we had on floppy discs that came from shady sources. Technically, I've been designing my own games
                since kindergarten, where I would often draw Super Mario levels, which probably freaked out the teachers,
                now that I think about it. :D
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytextleft">
                <b>MY JOURNEY</b><br>
                Throughout my game development journey, one thing that I've been enjoying a lot is trying out different tools and
                software, playing around with what's possible and how they can be broken. This allowed me to gain insight
                into various aspects of games, get familiar with the lingo and processes of different art workflows, which is a tremendous
                help in what became my focus later on: Technical Art.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytextleft">
                <b>TECH</b><br>
                My background in Computer Science and Software Development gave me a strong foundation when it comes to the
                technical aspects of development. I'm proficient mainly in C#, C++, and Python. During my studies on the Games&nbsp;MSc,
                I got introduced to shader languages too, such as GLSL and HLSL. I've been using the shader graphs and
                particle systems of Unreal&nbsp;Engine and Unity in various projects throughout my studies, as well as my
                personal projects.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytextleft">
                <b>ART</b><br>
                Drawing and arts & crafts have been my main hobbies ever since I can remember. But animation is my #1 comfort zone
                when it comes to visual storytelling. As a kid, I had hundreds of flipbooks with crudely drawn, stick figure
                animations. Even got into trouble a couple of times for making little movies on the corners of my school books.
                Animation just feels like doing magic, so no wonder I've been pursuing it for so long.
            </p>

            <p class="project_bodytextleft">
                <b>MY HOBBIES</b><br>
                gaming, movies, music (I play the violin, the guitar, the ukulele, and I hope I still remember the piano too :D),
                basketball, hiking & trekking<br>
                My absolute favorite games include ones that have massive, intricately crafted worlds, such as Dark Souls,
                Shadow of the Colossus, Red Dead Redemption, but also more artistically and emotionally challenging pieces too,
                such as Journey, Inside, or The Beginner's Guide.
